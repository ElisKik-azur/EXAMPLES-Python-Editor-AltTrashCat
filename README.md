### Running the tests on Windows or MacOS
The tests are meant to be run on an Windows or MacOS device. The app is provided in this repository, under the App/  folder.
To start the tests, depending of your OS run:
`./start_tests_Mac.sh`
or
`./start_tests_Windows.sh`


This script will:

- start the app on your device
- run the tests
- stop the app after the test are done
